 NAME
         restart - run the test program beginning with the on_restart procedure
 
 SYNOPSIS
        restart
        
        The  restart  command  executes  the loaded program beginning in
        the  procedure   on_restart,  if  one  exists,   and   continues
        execution  with  on_start. This is usually  used if a part fails
        and some external alarm might have been the cause.
